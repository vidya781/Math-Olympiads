Problem 2
Let ABCD be a Square. Let X be any point on the side BC between B and C. Let Y be the point on CD such that BX = YD. 
Now D is between C and Y. Prove midpoint of XY lies on the diagonal BD.

The approach of this problem can be done either by vector geometry or coordinate geometry.

Let B be (0,0) and A be (0,1). Let C (1,0) and D (1,1). Let X be at d units from B so X (d,0)
Let Y be (1,1+d) as per the problem.
Equation of diagonal BD = (1-0)/(1-0) = 1 and y = x is the equation of diagonal BD
Now the midpoint of XY is { (1+d)/2,(1+d)/2 }
Since x,y coordinates are the same, the point lies on line BD
Point of intersection of XY and BD, slope ((1+d)-0) / (1-d) = (1+d)/(1-d)
Equation of this line y - 0 = (1+d)/(1-d) ( x - d)
=> y = (1+d)/(1-d) [ x-d ]
Therefore to find the point of intersection of y = x and the above line, we simply substitute y = x
x = (1+d)/(1-d) (x-d)
d(1+d)/(1-d) = x[ 1+d - 1 + d]/(1-d)
=> d(1+d) = x(2d)
=> x = (1+d)/2
Similarly y = x, the point of intersection now becomes ((1+d)/2, (1+d)/2) which is the mid point of BD given the 
coordinates of the end point.

Problem 3

In T(ABC), points D and E lie on the interior of segments AB and AC respectively such that AD = 1, DB = 2, BC = 4, CE = 2,
EA = 3. Let DE intersect BC at F. Determine the length of CF.

Solution : First notice that the sidelengths of T(ABC) are 3, 4 and 5. By Pythagoras, this implies that T(ABC) is right angled at B.
Now we can put the figure on the coordiante axes such that B = (0,0) and A = (0,3) and C = (4,0). Furthermore we get D(0,2) and since E
divides CA into the ratio 2:3 we get E = (2.4,1.2) 
{ we use internal section formula (mx2 + nx1)/(m+n), (my2+ny1)/(m+n) } 

Now we can calculate the slope of the line DE to be -0.8/2.4 = -1/3
This means that the equation of the line DE is given by y = -(x/3) + 2.
Therefore the x intercept of this line is the solution to 0 = -(x/3) + 2. The solution is when x = 6, and thus F = (6,0).
Hence CF = 2
