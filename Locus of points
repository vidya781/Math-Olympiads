Let ABC be an equilateral Triangle. Find the locus of points P in the plane with the property that PA, PB and PC are 
the sides of an equilateral Triangle.

Solution:

As we will find out the locus is a circle.We let the equations do the talking.

Here's how.
Let P(x,y) be a point in the plane. Let A (0, root(3)/2) B ( 1/2,0) and C(-1/2,0)
Wherein we choose side of the equilateral T to be equal to 1.

If we choose an orientation of the Triangle such that A-C-B in clockwise order and P on the side of C 
then PB^2 = PA^2 + PC^2

=> (x + 1/2)^2 + y^2 = x^2 + (y - root(3)/2)^2 + (x-1/2)^2 + y^2
=> 2x = - root(3) y + 3/4 + x^2 + y^2
=> (x-1)^2 + (y - root(3)/2)^2 = 1^2
And this is the general formula that represents a circle with Centre ( 1,root(3)/2) and Radius = 1
