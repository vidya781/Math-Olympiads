This problem appeared in the AMTI-NMTC exam. 

In T(ABC), AD is the median dividing BC into BD and DC ( equal parts ). One has to prove that (AB + AC - BC)/2 < AD.

Solution:

Consider the following diagram T(ABC):

When one draws out the median, that would divide the T into ABD and ADC.

Applying Triangle inequality into ABD, we get AD + BD > AB,
=> AD + BC/2 > AB
=> AD > AB - (BC/2)

Applying Triangle inequality into ADC, we get AD + DC > AC
=> AD > AC - (BC/2)

Adding the 2 inequalities above, we get:
=> 2AD > AB + AC - BC
=> AD > (AB + AC - BC)/2
=> (AB + AC - BC )/2 < AD
