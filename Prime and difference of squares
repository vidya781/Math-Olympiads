This problem appeared in the AMTI Subjective Test.

A^2-B^2 = 17. A, B are integers. Find all possible solutions.

(A+B)(A-B) = 1 X 17

so A+B = 17
   A-B = 1
   
   Adding the two equations, 2A = 18 , => A = 9
   B = 8
   
   Also, A+B = 1
         A-B = 17
         
   Adding the two equations, 2A = 18, => A = 9
   B = - 8
   
   Thus the two solutions are (9,8) and (9,-8)
